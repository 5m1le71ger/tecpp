WPF client that connects to a <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/eternal-city">Multi-User Dungeon(MUD)</a> via Sockets. It's an exercise in handling sockets asynchronously (fun with multi-threading), and heavy string parsing (making sense of non-character data to trigger text colors, styles, spacing etc), as well as tooling additions that enhance the playability of the game.

Next steps are to move functionality out into separate code files, and build more of a library/framework hierarchy out of the components.
